<p>The Solar System[d] is the gravitationally bound system of the Sun and the objects that orbit it.[11] It
formed about 4.6 billion years ago when a dense region of a molecular cloud collapsed, forming the Sun
and a protoplanetary disc. The Sun is a typical star that maintains a balanced equilibrium by the fusion
of hydrogen into helium at its core, releasing this energy from its outer photosphere. Astronomers
classify it as a G-type main-sequence star.
The largest objects that orbit the Sun are the eight planets. In order from the Sun, they are four
terrestrial planets (Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars); two gas giants (Jupiter and Saturn); and two ice
giants (Uranus and Neptune). All terrestrial planets have solid surfaces. Inversely, all giant planets do not
have a definite surface, as they are mainly composed of gases and liquids. Over 99.86% of the Solar
System's mass is in the Sun and nearly 90% of the remaining mass is in Jupiter and Saturn.
There is a strong consensus among astronomers[e] that the Solar System has at least nine dwarf planets:
Ceres, Orcus, Pluto, Haumea, Quaoar, Makemake, Gonggong, Eris, and Sedna. There are a vast number
of small Solar System bodies, such as asteroids, comets, centaurs, meteoroids, and interplanetary dust
clouds. Some of these bodies are in the asteroid belt (between Mars's and Jupiter's orbit) and the Kuiper
belt (just outside Neptune's orbit).[f] Six planets, seven dwarf planets, and other bodies have orbiting
natural satellites, which are commonly called 'moons'.
The Solar System is constantly flooded by the Sun's charged particles, the solar wind, forming the
heliosphere. Around 75–90 astronomical units from the Sun,[g] the solar wind is halted, resulting in the
heliopause. This is the boundary of the Solar System to interstellar space. The outermost region of the
Solar System is the theorized Oort cloud, the source for long-period comets, extending to a radius of
2,000–200,000 AU. The closest star to the Solar System, Proxima Centauri, is 4.25 light-years (269,000
AU) away. Both stars belong to the Milky Way galaxy.</p>

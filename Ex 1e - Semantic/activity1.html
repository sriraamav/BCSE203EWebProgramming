        One of my most important qualities is being a <b style="color: #28a745;">team player</b>. I believe that collaboration and communication are key to achieving great results. Whether it's a group project or a club activity, I strive to bring my best to the table and ensure the team's success. I am particularly fascinated by <span style="background-color: #fff3cd; color: #856404; padding: 2px;">Artificial Intelligence</span> and its potential to shape a sustainable future.

        Besides academics, I actively participate in various co-curricular activities, including organizing events and workshops. I recently contributed to designing posters for an AI-themed quiz and a knowledge-sharing session. These experiences have helped me enhance my <em style="color: #6c757d;">design skills</em> and foster a keen eye for aesthetics. My motto in life is to <strong style="color: #ffc107;">learn</strong>, <b style="color: #17a2b8;">create</b>, and <em style="color: #6610f2;">grow</em>.
